**Code:** [10334.cpp](./10334.cpp)

# Comments

This problem would have been much easier to solve using Java, but the IOI no longer supports Java and thus for practice I wrote the BigInteger implementation myself using C++.

# Explanation

**Time Complexity:** O(NM)

**Memory Complexity:** O(NM)

Where N is the maximum value of N, and M is the length of the resulting number of ways from N intersections.
