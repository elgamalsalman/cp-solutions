**Code:** [10459.cpp](./10459.cpp)

# Explanation

**Time Complexity:** O(NlogN)

**Memory Complexity:** O(N)

**Category:** DP / Graph Theory / Diameter of a Tree

This problem probably could have been solved with a simple O(N<sup>2</sup>) code which runs dfs from every vertex; however as challenge I wanted to solve it in O(NlogN) and thus my code is a bit more complicated.
